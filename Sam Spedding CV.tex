\section{Work Experience}

\doubledatedsubsection{C++ Software Engineer}{Datamine Software Ltd., Bristol}{ March 2022 -- Present}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Create and maintain cutting edge geological resource modelling desktop applications using C++14.
	\item Lead developer on a brand new geological modelling application. Personally responsible for fundamental architectural and design decisions.
	\item Conceptualize and implement novel algorithms for processing geological data to create accurate structural models. Created a unique interactive tool to model geological faults and visualise them in 3D.
	\item Enhance and maintain existing structural modelling tools. Refactored swathes of legacy code resulting in speedups of 2000\% in Datamine's flagship minimum curvature implicit modelling tools.
	\item Colaborate closely with product owners and consultants to design and implement attractive UI.
\end{itemize}

\doubledatedsubsection{Graduate Software Engineer}{Micro Focus -- IDOL Connectors Team, Cambridge}{August 2021 -- March 2022}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Self-taught C++17 and modern coding standards with minimal supervision and support.
	\item Developed tools that connect to a wide variety of online data repositories and extract both structured and unstructured data.
\end{itemize}

\doubledatedsubsection{Online A-Level Maths and Further Maths Tutor}{\href{https://www.mytutor.co.uk/tutors/92167/}{mytutor.co.uk/tutors/92167/}}{2018 -- 2021}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Built friendly but professional relationships with tutees and their parents, schedule and plan lessons, and tailor my teaching and communication styles to suit the needs of the pupil and build confidence.
	\item 5-star average rating from over 100 reviews from tutees, having completed over 400 lessons.
\end{itemize}

\doubledatedsubsection{APDE Maths Caf\'e Leader}{School of Mathematics, University of Bristol}{2019 -- 2021}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Ran the drop-in session for Year 2 module ‘Applied Partial Differential Equations’, and provided hints, tips and solutions to homework problems, as well as peer-to-peer support for students seeking advice.
\end{itemize}

\doubledatedsubsection{Group Research Studentship}{School of Mathematics, University of Bristol}{Summer 2020}
\textit{A Phase Space Analysis of 2 Degree-of-Freedom Hamiltonian Systems in Chemical Reaction Dynamics.} \\
Supervisors: Dr. Shibabrat Naik, Prof. Stephen Wiggins\\
Github repository: \url{https://github.com/samspedding/hamiltonian-systems}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Used Numpy and Scipy Python libraries to conduct a numerical analysis of a variety of Hamiltonian systems with applications in isomerisation dynamics, computing statistical-mechanical quantities to compare with theory.
	\item Used MatPlotLib library to display high-dimensional data in new and insightful ways, including phase-space colour maps and animations of trajectories.
	\item Presented findings in a fifteen minute group presentation. Learnt a lot about communicating mathematical concepts to relative non-specialists and organising a talk as a group.
\end{itemize}

\section{Additional Skills}
\textbf{Software:} 3 years' industry experience with modern C++. Confident using Python for various scripting, scientific computing and data visualisation purposes. Experienced user of git, Azure Devops, and Jira. Proficient in \LaTeX\ and MS Office.\\
\textbf{Languages:} Intermediate level Spanish (A level).

\section{Interests}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Blues and jazz pianist who occasionally dabbles in classical piano.
