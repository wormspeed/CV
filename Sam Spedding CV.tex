\section{Work Experience}

\doubledatedsubsection{C++ Software Engineer}{Datamine Software Ltd., Bristol}{ March 2022 -- Present}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Develop cutting edge software used for geological modelling in the mining industry using C++.
	\item Conceptualize and develop back-end algorithms for processing field data to create accurate geological models. Created a unique tool to model geological faults and visualise them in 3D.
	\item Work with product owners to design and implement interactive, attractive UI.
	\item Personally responsible for key architecture and design decisions of a brand new desktop product.
	\item UI developed within the MFC framework for Windows desktop applications, utilizing the BCG library for a modern MS Office-like look-and-feel.
\end{itemize}

\doubledatedsubsection{Graduate Software Engineer}{Micro Focus -- IDOL Connectors Team, Cambridge}{August 2021 -- March 2022}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Develop tools in C++ that connect to a wide variety of online data repositories and extract both structured and unstructured data.
	\item Self-taught C++ and modern, industry-standard coding techniques on the job and am acquiring new skills from fellow team members and online resources on a daily basis.
	\item Have gained confidence with working with large amounts of unfamiliar code. Acquired experience in both fixing existing code and developing new features, such as the Zoom Connector.
\end{itemize}

\textit{A Phase Space Analysis of 2 Degree-of-Freedom Hamiltonian Systems in Chemical Reaction Dynamics.} \\
Supervisors: Dr. Shibabrat Naik, Prof. Stephen Wiggins\\
Github repository: \url{https://github.com/samspedding/hamiltonian-systems}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Used Numpy and Scipy Python libraries to conduct a numerical analysis of a variety of Hamiltonian systems with applications in isomerisation dynamics, computing statistical-mechanical quantities to compare with theory.
	\item Used MatPlotLib library to display high-dimensional data in new and insightful ways, including phase-space colour maps and animations of trajectories.
	\item Presented findings in a fifteen minute group presentation. Learnt a lot about communicating mathematical concepts to relative non-specialists and organising a talk as a group.
